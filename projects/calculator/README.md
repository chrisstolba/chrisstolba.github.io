# javascript Calculator
Basic calculator built from html, css, and javascript.


Objective: Build a calculator that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.

1) Can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

2) Can clear the input field with a clear button.

3) Can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
