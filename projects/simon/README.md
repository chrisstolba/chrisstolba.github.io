# simon-game
A basic game where you repeat a given pattern that gets longer and longer with success.

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE.



1) Presented with a random series of button presses.

2) Each series inputed correctly then offeres the same series with an additional step.

3) Each button has a corresponding sound that plays during computer display and player attempts.

4) If the wrong button is pressed the player is notified visually and with an error tone. The game will replay the same series to remind the user of the correct pattern and let them try again.

5) There is an option to play in "strict" mode which starts the game over after an error.

6) The number of steps for the current series is displayed.

7) There is a reset or restart button.

8) Victory notification is shown after 20 inputs are successfully input. The game then starts over.
