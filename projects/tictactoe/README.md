# tic-tac-toe
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game.


Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy/.


1) Can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

2) My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.

3) Can choose whether I want to play as X or O.
