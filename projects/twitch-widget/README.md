# Twitch-Streamer-Widget
Track freecodecamp.org streamers on twitch.tv and get basic information about when they are online and streaming.


Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.

1) Can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

2) Can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

3) Can see additional details about what they are streaming.


- Hint: See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541.
- Hint: The relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/streams/#get-stream-by-user.
- Hint: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]
- UPDATE: Due to a change in conditions on API usage explained here Twitch.tv now requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use https://wind-bow.glitch.me/twitch-api instead of twitch's API base URL (i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/kraken ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.
